## 👋 Welcome to Ripple

### Island

##### *The part of the interface you interact with is called the Island.*

## There are 3 main modes in the interface

### Large Mode

##### *When you click on the Island this mode will be active. It's the mode you will use the most, and it contains all Tabs you use.*

### Quick Mode

##### *When you hover over the Island you'll see this. Information like time, weather, and battery alerts will show here. If music is playing, it will also show "Now Playing" info with a smooth expansion and hover-activated playback controls.*

### Still Mode

##### *This is the idle mode you see when the Island is inactive. It's now more subtle and smaller (170px) to stay out of your way until needed.*

## These are 2 optional modes

### Stealth Mode 

##### *A mode that hides the Island when it's inactive (completely transparent).*
