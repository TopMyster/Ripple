## There are 3 main modes in the interface

### Large Mode

##### *When you click on the Island this mode will be active. It's the mode you will use the most, and it contains all Tabs you use.*

### Quick Mode

##### *When you hover over the Island you'll see this. It contains the time, weather, and if you have battery alerts there, those will show too.*
